      "4.2 Road Network Design Elements": "Design parameters represent the fundamental principles and standards upon which the engineering design of the road network is based. These parameters encompass a range of technical, functional, and environmental factors that directly influence the selection of design elements—such as design speeds, design vehicle dimensions, longitudinal and cross slopes, terrain characteristics, and safety requirements. The design criteria are derived from recognized local and international codes and standards to ensure operational efficiency, user safety, and long-term infrastructure sustainability. The key design parameters are outlined in the following section",
      "4.2.1 Road Hierarchy": "The design of the road network is based on the hierarchical classification principle, which categorizes roads according to their function and level of service into arterial roads, collector roads, and local roads. This classification ensures smooth traffic flow, operational efficiency, and the organized distribution of traffic loads. The hierarchy is defined in alignment with the urban master plan of the area and through effective integration with the existing and regional road networks to ensure easy accessibility and seamless connectivity between internal and external areas. The design also considers the provision of safe entry and exits points, and an appropriate distribution of intersections to minimize conflict points and enhance traffic safety. Furthermore, this classification plays a vital role in determining design speeds. The (table 3) presents the engineering characteristics of each road classification in the project according to the international Code:\nTable 2: Engineering Characteristics of Road Classification",
      "4.2.2 Design Vehicle": "The design vehicle chosen is a single-unit truck, which matches the SU-12 vehicle type according to the American AASHTO code. This is in line with the nature of the project’s operations. The length of the SU-12 vehicle is approximately 12 meters, and it is used as a reference to determine the design dimensions of road network components such as lane widths, curve radii, turning areas, and particularly at intersections, entrances, exits, and loading/unloading zones. The design considers providing appropriate pathways for these vehicles, ensuring smooth traffic flow and road safety in an efficient industrial operational environment. The following figure illustrates the engineering characteristics of the design vehicle, and its dimensions as follows:\nFigure 5: Engineering Characteristics of the Design Vehicle",
      "4.2.3 Stopping Sight Distance:": "Stopping Sight Distance (SSD) is crucial for road design as it directly impacts road safety, especially in situations with sudden changes in speed or direction or unexpected obstacles. SSD helps determine design requirements for curves, intersections, and traffic signs. Given the project’s road types, SSD is used as the primary reference to ensure drivers can safely stop in case of an obstacle. It is based on the design speed, driver reaction time, road gradient, and tire-road friction. SSD is key to ensuring traffic safety, reducing accidents, and improving road efficiency. The following table (Table 4) shows the values of the required SSD for different design speeds according to the international code.\nTable 3: Stopping Sight Distance for design speeds",
      "4.2.4 Horizontal Curves": "Determining the horizontal curve radius is a key element in road design, as it directly affects vehicle safety and stability during turning. It is selected based on the design speed and superelevation, to ensure proper balance of centrifugal and lateral forces, especially on industrial roads used by heavy trucks. A specific formula is used to calculate the required radius based on speed and superelevation, with reference to standard tables provided in the AASHTO codes.\ne+fs = v2/127R\nR = Minimum radius of circular curve (m)\nV = Design speed (km/h)\ne = Maximum super elevation rate %\nfs = side friction factor",
      "4.2.5 Vertical Curves": "Vertical curves are designed to provide adequate sight distance for drivers and ensure safe and smooth transitions between different road grades. The length of vertical curves is calculated using a standard formula, and the rate of curvature (K) is determined based on the design speed and stopping sight distance (SSD), using tables provided in the AASHTO code.\nLc = K A\nLc =Vertical curve length (m)\nK = Rate of change of curvature\nA = Algebraic difference of grades\nLongitudinal slopes are also a key factor in vertical alignment planning. They vary significantly based on the road classification and design speed. The table (Table5)  below shows the permissible longitudinal slope values according to the MOT:\nTable 4: Permissible Longitudinal Slope Values\nHowever, it is recommended that the slope does not exceed 4% to ensure smooth, safe, and efficient vehicle movement—especially considering the nature of the project roads.",
      "4.2.6 Pavement Design": "Pavement structural design depends on available data such as traffic volumes, soil properties at the site, materials used in the pavement layers, and environmental factors specific to the project location. In the absence of such data, the standard pavement sections provided in the intrnational Code are used as a reference.",
      "4.2.7 Road Markings & Traffic Signs": "Pavement markings and road signs are essential complementary elements in road design and safety, as they directly contribute to traffic regulation, safety enhancement, and guidance for road users. Pavement markings include lane lines, stop lines, pedestrian crossings, and directional arrows, while signage includes warning, regulatory, and directional/informational signs. These elements are designed according to the standards outlined in the Highway Standards and/or the MUTCD (Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices) to ensure clear visibility and easy understanding for all driver categories—particularly in industrial areas that require precise management of heavy and service vehicle movements. The placement of signs and markings also considers factors such as sight distance, appropriate location, retroreflectivity, and suitable size to ensure effectiveness during both day and night.",
      "4.2.8 Required Data": "To prepare the required road design work, the following data must be provided:\nGeneral layout plan (after approval of the master plan).\nTopographic survey (to be provided by the client).\nSoil report (to be provided by the client).\nTraffic study, if available (to be provided by the client).",
      "4.3 Wet Utilities Design Methodology": "This scope includes all wet utility systems required for industrial operations. The design and shop drawings cover only the distribution networks located within the site boundaries. Centralized facilities such as water treatment plants, sewage treatment plants, and water storage reservoirs are not included in this proposal and may be considered under additional services upon specific request from SID. The process has been divided into Four main stages, each comprising a set of specific tasks and technical deliverables, as outlined below:",
      "4.3.1 Step 01: Data Collection and Analysis": "Following receipt of the approved masterplan, AIEcon will review and assess all relevant design inputs, including project survey data, geotechnical studies, hydrogeological conditions, existing utilities, meteorological data, and local design standards.

      "Introduction": "Energy Valley Solar PV is committed to maintaining the highest standards of safety and operational efficiency for its renewable energy infrastructure. To ensure the long-term resilience of the project, Energy Valley has identified the need to mitigate potential risks associated with pluvial and fluvial flooding, as well as erosion hazards that may impact the planned solar fields and associated infrastructure. These hydrological events pose a threat to the safety and structural integrity of the site’s foundations, equipment pads, and access roads.\nThis document presents the technical and financial proposal for the Energy Valley Solar PV in Minya, Egypt project. The proposal outlines a comprehensive approach to the Hydrology Assessment study. The design will be prepared in compliance with local standards, Egypt Codes, local authority regulations, and relevant international standards, ensuring high-quality, resilient infrastructure suitable for industrial use.\nSustainability is central to our methodology, with solutions aimed at supporting environmental objectives, energy efficiency, and long-term operational viability. This proposal details the technical scope, methodology, deliverables, and financial offer required to realize these goals.\nThis technical and financial proposal is submitted by AIEcon’s team, a seasoned civil engineering consultancy firm with over 35 years of practical experience in the field. We approach this project with a full-service mindset, applying the international and local standards, and delivering comprehensive Civil 3D and AutoCAD-based design documentation tailored to the industrial sector.",

      "Project Scope": "",
      "4.1 Project Scope Statement": "They are further broken down into the following sub-tasks:\nMeteorological Studies; To estimate the design storm and develop the IDF for the study area.\nMorphological Studies; To estimate the physical parameters of the drainage areas expected to affect the risk of flooding on the pipe route.\nHydrological Analysis; To estimate the peak runoff (design) flow rates for the effective wadis at their crossing locations with the pipe route. Hydrographs of surface runoff will be determined using rainfall-runoff models (i.e., HEC-HMS).\nFlood Modelling: Perform 2-D unsteady flow analysis (using software like HEC-RAS) to assess pre- and post-development scenarios and ensure mitigation strategies do not negatively impact surrounding areas.\nScour Analysis: Estimate potential scour values around foundation locations and equipment pads, proposing cost-effective mitigation actions for erosion control.\nDesign of the Flood Protection system; Based on the findings of the Morphological analysis, one or more alternative of flood protection schemes will be proposed. This will include;\nEvaluation for the whole route including all executed Flood Mitigation works (open channels, Pipes & etc.)\nDrainage solution for the proposed route.\nDesign of additional required new storm dikes, channels or new structure for flood mitigation.",
      "Project Methodology": "",
      "Hydrological Assessment": "The specific aims of this study is to carry out relevant technical investigations comprising of flood protection management plan, topographical surveys, hydrologic and hydraulic analyses and design as well as conduct a design review process for previous evaluations/studies.\nSimilarly, the study will determine the needs/demands and the potential for multipurpose infrastructure development, conduct the required studies/investigations, review the baseline information about the current conditions of existing structures and facilities in the project area as provided by the Client in the initial phase and consequently prepare the detailed engineering designs as an integral part of the scheme. Finally, the consultants will prepare cost estimates, which will form the basis for project appraisal and implementation.\nIn summary, the following tasks describe the above-mentioned goals: -\n•\tCarryout hydrological and hydrogeological studies for the target area(s);\n•\tUndertake specific topographical survey at the basin boundaries;\n•\tTo produce several viable options for flood mitigation schemes;\n•\tTo propose the implementation methodology and recommended engineering solutions; and\n•\tTo supervise the implementation in accordance with the proposed designs.",
      "Meteorological Analysis": "In order to come up with the design storm rainfall value and Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) relations the rainfall data obtained will be analyzed using the recommended statistical methods and computer models (e.g. Hydrologic Frequency Analysis – HyFrAn). The frequency analysis will be done to define the design storm for different return periods that will be further used during the flood protection elements design, see Figure 5.\nFigure 5: Rainfall analysis and IDF Curves",
      "Morphological Analysis": "Physical parameters of the drainage areas are very significant for the hydrologic analysis. The topographic maps as well as aerial photos and satellite images will be used to define the drainage pattern of the effective watersheds that could convey surface runoff towards the project area using applicable models and software (i.e. Arc-GIS Hydro tool), see\nFigure 6.\nGround checking will be carried out with the site visit findings to check the morphological studies results and review the overall slopes in order to maintain the requirements of the exterior flood protection schemes. Based on the analysis results, the morphological parameters will be calculated including;\nWatershed area,\nLongest flow path length,\nStream slope\nTime of concentration and lag time.\nFigure 6: Example of Morphological Analysis using GIS",
      "Hydrological Analysis & Peak Flow Estimation": "The design discharge is calculated based on a pre-selected recurrence interval using applicable models and software (i.e HEC-HMS). The design discharges will be used to estimate the final dimension of the proposed drainage works using different methods widely used for these purposes (i.e. SCS method and rational method). The hydraulic design aims to provide a drainage structure of adequate capacity that can safely convey the design flow without significant damages or inconveniences water in order to guarantee the maximum protection of the project structures against generated runoff and ensure smooth flow rate of water. Figure 7 shows a sample of the output of a runoff hydrograph for a generic watershed.\nFigure 7: Example of Runoff Hydrograph from HEC-HMS",
      "Rainfall/Runoff 2D simulation (using HEC-RAS Model)": "In order to delineate the extents of flood prone areas related to the adopted design storm and prepare the corresponding hazard map, a 2D rainfall/runoff hydrodynamic model is going to be implemented. 2D models are capable of providing information regarding not only the inundation depth and its spatial distribution but also the variation of flood extent and flow velocities over a user-defined period. Thus, 2D models are gaining popularity due to their accuracy in representing the phenomenon in question in much finer details compared to the traditional 1D approach. By implementing the 2D approach, the terrain is divided into fluid cells, and each variable is assumed constant within these cells (depth-averaged values). As such, all the input/output hydrological and hydraulic parameters are assumed uniform within a cell.\nThe 2D component of HEC-RAS model, a freely available hydraulic modeling package will be utilized for the course of this investigation. The Hydrologic Engineering Center’s (HEC) River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) software allows the user to perform one-dimensional (1D) steady and two-dimensional (2D) unsteady river flow hydraulic calculations. HEC-RAS is an integrated system of software and is comprised of a graphical user interface, separate hydraulic analysis components, data storage and management capabilities, graphics, mapping (HEC-RAS Mapper) and reporting facilities.",
      "Sediment Transport and Scour Study": "The processes that cause sediments and their fate are erosion, transport, deposition and compaction. The installation of dams on rivers is always accompanied by hydro-morphological and physio-chemical modifications, disrupting in particular sedimentary but also ecological continuity. These structures will modify the hydrological regime of the rivers concerned, moving from fluvial dynamic regimes (with current-related turbulence) to static regimes close to lake domains (calmer regimes, less turbulence). This regime modification allows the privileged accumulation of fine particles near the dam while the coarser ones will be more abundant at the tail end of the dam. The percentage of sediment trapped will depend on the residence time of the water body in the dam.\nTo that end, the Consultant shall conduct the necessary hydrodynamic modeling using the Sediment Transport component in HEC-RAS to investigate residence time and compare it to the observed water levels in the dam reservoir and relate the output to the design storm return period. The aim is to evaluate the impacts on the downstream structures. This depends in particular on the height of the structure, its location – more or less upstream of the catchment area, the existence of successive dams on the same watercourse.\nSample of Scour depth calculation (for Mountain Reservoir carrier Pipeline – Neom)",
      "Flood Protection Scheme(s)": "The projected SOW includes identification of flood hazards and associated risks caused by large Wadis (stream paths) affecting the proposed study area. Throughout the duration of the project timeline, a complete hydrological and hydraulic assessment will be conducted to evaluate site-specific hydrologic conditions, state the design specifications as well as propose the appropriate protection and safety measures that should be adopted.\nBased on findings from the previous analysis, different alternatives of flood protection measurements will be proposed and implemented within the general layout of the project showing the following:\nLocations and proposed for the protection works.\nStructure type and preliminary sizes.",
      "Data Collection": "The Master Plan of the new development area will form the basis for the design of all infrastructure network. The initial tasks to be undertaken will be primarily concerned with the review of the Master Plan and compilation of pertinent information/ data and assessment of existing services. The following information is vital for the successful completion of the aforementioned in scope of services:\nRelevant data from the Master Planner.\nSurvey of the Project area (Including all Drainage Structures) in digital format.\nPrevious geotechnical and geological studies.\nHydro-geological and groundwater aquifers data.\nInventory of existing/proposed structures, features and utilities surrounding the project site.\nExisting and future off-site utilities schemes (if available).\nSite-specific constraints (if any).\nDesign Standards and local regulations for all works related to wet utilities.\nMeteorological Data.",
      "Computer Models and Software Packages": "Proper computer models will be used, where suitable, to calculate the peak flow from catchments, and to size the selected drainage structures. Recommended software includes:\nGIS techniques (Arc-Hydro Tools, Spatial Analyst, etc…) and Watershed Modeling System (WMS) will be used to delineate the watersheds and estimate watershed characteristics.\nHEC-SSP program will be used to conduct a frequency analysis for the updated rainfall data.\nAppropriate spreadsheet (MS Excel) and HEC-HMS package, will be used to estimate the peak flow/flow hydrograph and to estimate the other hydrologic parameters where needed.\nHydraulic Toolbox/ Bentley FlowMaster will be used to estimate the initial sizing for diversion and conveyance channels and estimate riprap sizing if needed.\nThe 2D component of HEC-RAS, a freely available hydraulic modeling package will be utilized for the course of this investigation.",
      "Timeline and Phasing": "The Consultants will be immersed in analyzing all data and relevant information including specific site conditions and meteorological data, together with all other existing/planned Projects in the proximity of the Site. This entails the following stages:\nTable 2: Project time schedule",
      "Deliverables List": "The project timeline can be categorized into three distinctive stages as follows:\nStage I: Concept Design\nHydrology assessment report including the following:\nAll methods, data sources and assumptions used to determine the flood risks\nas well as the final recommendations for flood management solutions\nImpact of the recommended flood mitigation methods on the Project and\nsurrounding\nStage II: Detailed Design Report\nDetailed Design Drawings for Flood Protection Works (Layout Plans, Longitudinal Profiles).\nTypical details drawings.\nA map of flood features showing depth and velocity of flow.\nFinal Report.\nB.O.Q.\nAIEConLLC"

In this context, a new huge national project “Electrical Express Train” is\nstarted with an estimated design speed of about 250 km/h for the train, that means\nthat the distance from 6th of October City, Luxor, Aswan and Abu Simbel near the\nSudan border can be traveled in about 5.5-hrs.

Analysis\nThe hydrological study aims to determine the peak values of surface runoff and\nflowing water volumes depending on the morphological and meteorological study\ntaking into account the design storms and their distribution and the areas affected by\nthese storms, and Surface runoff is the rate of movement or discharge of water\n(volume / time) in natural watercourses.\nFactors affecting runoff can be divided into rainfall-related factors such as rainfall\nintensity, duration of rainfall, return period of rainfall, distribution of rainfall over\nwatershed, and other factors associated with the watershed such as the area, the\nlength of the main stream, the slope of the main stream and the shape of the\nwatershed, as well as soil-related factors such as infiltration and land cover/use types,\nthe following are the mathematical methods that can be used to estimate the maximum\nrunoff from the contributing watersheds to the embankment under study according to\nthe data available and the most relevant to the case being studied.\n4.1 Design Storm Distribution\nThe SCS Type II design storm distribution is the most commonly used rainfall\ndistribution in the arid and semi-arid regions as it provides logical and safe values, due\nto its dependence on the concentration of the bulk of rainfall in a short time .

Whenever water attacks the area under development, the flows\nmust be estimated accurately as possible and transported safely, so the design aims\nto provide drainage facilities that are capable of accommodation of the largest flood\ndischarges with the least maintenance over its lifetime.\nThe hydraulic design process consists of setting standards, developing, and\nevaluating alternatives, and selecting the alternative that meets the design standards.\n5.2 Returned Period\nIt is the frequency of storms within a specified period of time. The extent of the storm\nfrequency reflects the severity of the floods. The choice of the design period depends on the\nimportance and location of the proposed protection work. Table 6 shows the proposed\nprotection works & their returned periods.\nTable 6 Returned periods for the protection works\nProtection work\nReturned period for the design storm\nDams\n100-200 years\nBridge\n100 years\nCulvert\n100 years\nSlope protection\n100 years\nChute\n100 years\nDiversion Channel\n100 years\nSide Ditch\n100 years\nDike\n100 years\nAddress: Egypt: Villa 65, Mohamed Farid Axis, Hamd Sq., 5th Settlement, Cairo.\nUSA: 1856 Algonquin rd., Iowa City, IA 52245, Iowa State\nEmail: info@aiecons.com\nWebsite: www.aiecons.com\n- 31 -\nHydrological Study & Flood Protection Report\nElectrical Express Train-Blue Line\nSector ’C’ Part (1)\n5.3 Design Standards\n-\nWater drained as much as possible into the natural wadi path instead of\ndiverting it or allowing water to be stored and stagnant.\n-\nMinimize the protection works as possible.\n-\nAll protection works for this project are designed/assessed against return\nperiod of 100 years' storm event.\n-\nTaking into consideration the economic aspects by decreasing the cost of\nrequired protection system as much as possible by achieving safe and\noptimum design.\n-\nWater velocity should be kept within the allowable range to avoid the risks\nof scouring in the downstream of the flood mitigation structures.\n5.4 Hydraulic design basis\n5.4.1 Culvert\nThe following considerations are taken in designing and evaluating culverts:\n• The minimum size of the circular culvert is Two openings with diameter (1\nmeter).\n• The minimum size of the Box culvert is Two opening with Width=2m and\nHeight =1.5m\n• The maximum water level in the upstream of the flow before entering the\nculvert should not exceed 1.2 x (culvert height).\n• Grading should be provided when needed at the entrance and exit of the\nculvert as the natural condition of some areas includes scattered small hills\nspecially in the downstream area of the culvert that may cause obstruction\nof flow.\n• Protection work should be provided at the entrance and exit of the culvert for\nprotection against scouring. It is recommended to use loose riprap protection\nwhen the flow velocity is less than 6.5 m/s and if the velocity exceeds 6.5\nm/s, an energy dissipater system should be used.\nAddress: Egypt: Villa 65, Mohamed Farid Axis, Hamd Sq., 5th Settlement, Cairo.\nUSA: 1856 Algonquin rd., Iowa City, IA 52245, Iowa State\nEmail: info@aiecons.com\nWebsite: www.aiecons.com\n- 32 -\nHydrological Study & Flood Protection Report\nElectrical Express Train-Blue Line\nSector ’C’ Part (1)\nGenerally, flow in culverts occurs under one of this two situations: inlet control\nculvert or outlet control culvert. For culverts designed according to the condition of\ninlet control, the characteristics of the culvert entrance will be such that losses\noccurred at entrance section are the dominant element in determining the height of\nthe water level of the culvert.\nIt is customary for the culvert to be designed under conditions of flows that\nare not fully submerged, meaning that the entrance surface of the culvert is above the\nwater level flowing through it wherever possible. Note that the maximum water level in\nthe upstream of the culvert before entering the drain facilities should not exceed 1.2 x\n(height of the culvert).\nThe general equations used while the design phase of culverts are as follows:\nFor box culverts:\nQ = n ∗1.5 ∗W ∗H1.5\nFor pipe culverts:\nQ = n ∗1.232 ∗D2.5\nWhereas:\nn: No. of Culvert openings.\nW: Box Culvert Width (m).\nH: Box Culvert Height (m).\nD: Pipe Culvert Diameter (m).\n(CulvertMaster) program will be used to determine the sizes of the proposed\nculverts, as well as to determine the level of water level at the entrance of the culvert\nand the exit velocity of water from it.\nBox Culverts are designed of reinforced concrete in streams and wadis where\nthe concrete allows the passage of maximum discharges while using an economical\nconcrete section. The multi-openings culverts are used in watersheds and waterways\nwhen needed instead of bridges, in the case of watersheds that are characterized by\nlong, mild & very wide longitudinal slopes, and the cross-section of the wadi is not well\nAddress: Egypt: Villa 65, Mohamed Farid Axis, Hamd Sq., 5th Settlement, Cairo.\nUSA: 1856 Algonquin rd., Iowa City, IA 52245, Iowa State\nEmail: info@aiecons.com\nWebsite: www.aiecons.com\n- 33 -\nHydrological Study & Flood Protection Report\nElectrical Express Train-Blue Line\nSector ’C’ Part (1)\ndefined. The multi-openings culverts are designed to accommodate the maximum\nflows that are likely to pass through.\nEntrance and exit structures are connected to the culvert in order to reduce the\nerosion of the embankment or the rail and slopes in the downstream, to prevent\nseepage, protection of embankments and structural fixation of the ends to improve the\nhydraulic properties of the culvert.\n5.4.1.1 • Types of Culverts Control.\nA general description of the characteristics of inlet and outlet control flow is given\nbelow. A culvert flowing in inlet control has shallow, high velocity flow categorized as\n\"supercritical.\" For supercritical flow, the control section is at the upstream end of the\nbarrel (the inlet). Conversely, a culvert flowing in outlet control will have relatively deep,\nlower velocity flow termed \"subcritical\" flow. For subcritical flow the control is at the\ndownstream end of the culvert (the outlet). The tail water depth is either critical depth\nat the culvert outlet or the downstream channel depth, whichever is higher.\na. Inlet Control\nFigure 12 depicts several different examples of inlet control flow. The type of flow\ndepends on the submergence of the inlet and outlet ends of the culvert. In all of these\nexamples, the control section is at the inlet end of the culvert. Depending on the\ntailwater, a hydraulic jump may occur downstream of the inlet.\nFigure 12-A depicts a condition where neither the inlet nor the outlet end of the\nculvert are submerged. The flow passes through critical depth just downstream of the\nculvert entrance and the flow in the barrel is supercritical. The barrel flows partly full\nover its length, and the flow approaches normal depth at the outlet end.\nFigure 12-B shows that submergence of the outlet end of the culvert does not\nassure outlet control. In this case, the flow just downstream of the inlet is supercritical\nand a hydraulic jump forms in the culvert barrel.\nFigure 12-C is a more typical design situation. The inlet end is submerged, and the\noutlet end flows freely. Again, the flow is supercritical and the barrel flows partly full\nover its length. Critical depth is located just downstream of the culvert entrance, and\nthe flow is approaching normal depth at the downstream end of the culvert.\nAddress: Egypt: Villa 65, Mohamed Farid Axis, Hamd Sq., 5th Settlement, Cairo.\nUSA: 1856 Algonquin rd., Iowa City, IA 52245, Iowa State\nEmail: info@aiecons.com\nWebsite: www.aiecons.com\n- 34 -\nHydrological Study & Flood Protection Report\nElectrical Express Train-Blue Line\nSector ’C’ Part (1)\nFigure 12-D is an unusual condition illustrating the fact that even submergence of\nboth the inlet and the outlet ends of the culvert does not assure full flow. In this case,\na hydraulic jump will form in the barrel. The median inlet provides ventilation of the\nculvert barrel. If the barrel were not ventilated, sub-atmospheric pressures could\ndevelop which might create an unstable condition during which the barrel would\nalternate between full flow and partly full flow.\nFigure 12 Types of inlet control\n• Factors Influencing Inlet Control\nSince the control is at the upstream end in inlet control, only the headwater and\nthe inlet configuration affect the culvert performance. The Head water depth is\nmeasured from the invert of the inlet control section to the surface of the upstream\npool. The inlet area is the cross-sectional area of the face of the culvert. Generally, the\ninlet face area is the same as the barrel area, but for tapered inlets the face area is\nenlarged, and the control section is at the throat. The inlet edge configuration\nAddress: Egypt: Villa 65, Mohamed Farid Axis, Hamd Sq., 5th Settlement, Cairo.\nUSA: 1856 Algonquin rd., Iowa City, IA 52245, Iowa State\nEmail: info@aiecons.com\nWebsite: www.aiecons.com\n- 35 -\nHydrological Study & Flood Protection Report\nElectrical Express Train-Blue Line\nSector ’C’ Part (1)\ndescribes the entrance type. Some typical inlet edge configurations are thin edge\nprojecting, mitered, square edges in a headwall, and beveled edge. The inlet shapes\nusually the same as the shape of the culvert barrel; however, it may be enlarged as in\nthe case of a tapered inlet. Typical shapes are rectangular, circular, and elliptical.\nWhenever the inlet face is a different size or shape than the culvert barrel, the\npossibility of an additional control section within the barrel exists.\nAn additional factor which influences inlet control performance is the barrel\nslope. The effect is small, however, and it can be ignored, or a small slope correction\nfactor can be inserted in the inlet control equations.\nThe inlet edge configuration is a major factor in inlet control performance, and\nit can be modified to improve performance.\n• Inlet Control Calculations\nThe inlet control calculations determine the headwater elevation required to\npass the design flow through the selected culvert configuration in inlet control. The\napproach velocity head may be included as part of the headwater, if desired.\nThe inlet control nomographs are used in the design process. For the following\ndiscussion, refer to the schematic inlet control nomograph shown in Figure 13.\na. Locate the selected culvert size (point 1) and flow rate (point 2) on the\nappropriate scales of the inlet control nomograph. (Note that for box culverts, the\nflow rate per foot of barrel width is used.)\nb. Using a straightedge, carefully extend a straight line from the culvert size (point\n1) through the flow rate (point 2) and mark a point on the first headwater/culvert\nheight (HW/D) scale (point 3). The first HW/D scale is also a turning line.\nc. If another HW/D scale is required, extend a horizontal line from the first HW/D\nscale (the turning line) to the desired scale and read the result.\nd. Multiply HW/D by the culvert height, D, to obtain the required headwater (HW)\nfrom the invert of the control section to the energy grade line. If the approach\nvelocity is neglected, HW equals the required headwater depth (HWi).

If the FALL is acceptable, proceed to\nstep f.\n(3) If the FALL is positive and greater than is judged to be acceptable, select\nanother culvert configuration and begin again at step a.\nf. Calculate the inlet control section invert elevation as follows:\nEli = ELsf - Fall\nwhere Eli is the invert elevation at the face of a culvert (ELf) or at the throat of a\nculvert with a tapered inlet (ELt).\nAddress: Egypt: Villa 65, Mohamed Farid Axis, Hamd Sq., 5th Settlement, Cairo.\nUSA: 1856 Algonquin rd., Iowa City, IA 52245, Iowa State\nEmail: info@aiecons.com\nWebsite: www.aiecons.com\n- 37 -\nHydrological Study & Flood Protection Report\nElectrical Express Train-Blue Line\nSector ’C’ Part (1)\n.\nFigure 13 Inlet Control Nomograph (schematic)\nAddress: Egypt: Villa 65, Mohamed Farid Axis, Hamd Sq., 5th Settlement, Cairo.\nUSA: 1856 Algonquin rd., Iowa City, IA 52245, Iowa State\nEmail: info@aiecons.com\nWebsite: www.aiecons.com\n- 38 -\nHydrological Study & Flood Protection Report\nElectrical Express Train-Blue Line\nSector ’C’ Part (1)\nb.  Outlet Control\nFigure 14 illustrates various outlet control flow conditions. In all cases, the\ncontrol section is at the outlet end of the culvert or further downstream.\nCondition 14-A represents the classic full flow condition, with both inlet and\noutlet submerged.\nThe barrel is in pressure flow throughout its length. This condition is often\nassumed in calculations, but seldom actually exists.\nCondition 14-B depicts the outlet submerged with the inlet unsubmerged. For\nthis case, the headwater is shallow so that the inlet crown is exposed as the flow\ncontracts into the culvert.\nCondition 14-C shows the entrance submerged to such a degree that the\nculvert flows full throughout its entire length while the exit is unsubmerged. This is a\nrare condition. It requires an extremely high headwater to maintain full barrel flow with\nno tailwater. The outlet velocities are usually high under this condition.\nCondition 14-D is more typical. The culvert entrance is submerged by the\nheadwater and the outlet end flows freely with a low tailwater. For this condition, the\nbarrel flows partly full over at least part of its length (subcritical flow) and the flow\npasses through critical depth just upstream of the outlet.\nCondition 14-E is also typical, with neither the inlet nor the outlet ends of the\nculvert submerged.\nThe barrel flows partly full over its entire length, and the flow profile is\nsubcritical.\nAddress: Egypt: Villa 65, Mohamed Farid Axis, Hamd Sq., 5th Settlement, Cairo.\nUSA: 1856 Algonquin rd., Iowa City, IA 52245, Iowa State\nEmail: info@aiecons.com\nWebsite: www.aiecons.com\n- 39 -\nHydrological Study & Flood Protection Report\nElectrical Express Train-Blue Line\nSector ’C’ Part (1)\nFigure 14 Types of Outlet Control\n• Factors Influencing Outlet Control.\nAll the factors influencing the performance of a culvert in inlet control also\ninfluence culverts in outlet control. In addition, the barrel characteristics (roughness,\narea, shape, length, and slope) and the tailwater elevation affect culvert performance\nin outlet control.\nThe barrel roughness is a function of the material used to fabricate the barrel.\nTypical materials include concrete and corrugated metal. The roughness is\nrepresented by a hydraulic resistance coefficient such as the Manning’s n value.\nAddress: Egypt: Villa 65, Mohamed Farid Axis, Hamd Sq., 5th Settlement, Cairo.\nUSA: 1856 Algonquin rd., Iowa City, IA 52245, Iowa State\nEmail: info@aiecons.com\nWebsite: www.aiecons.com\n- 40 -\nHydrological Study & Flood Protection Report\nElectrical Express Train-Blue Line\nSector ’C’ Part (1)\nThe barrel area and barrel shape are self-explanatory.\nThe barrel length is the total culvert length from the entrance to the exit of the\nculvert. Because the design height of the barrel and the slope influence the actual\nlength, an approximation of barrel length is usually necessary to begin the design\nprocess.\nThe barrel slope is the actual slope of the culvert barrel. The barrel slope is\noften the same as the natural stream slope. However, when the culvert inlet is raised\nor lowered, the barrel slope is different from the stream slope.\nThe tailwater elevation is based on the downstream water surface elevation.\nBackwater calculations from a downstream control, a normal depth approximation, or\nfield observations are used to define the tailwater elevation.\n• Outlet Control Calculations\nThe outlet control calculations result in the headwater elevation required to\nconvey the design discharge through the selected culvert in outlet control. The\napproach and downstream velocities may be included in the design process, if desired.\nThe critical depth charts and outlet control nomographs of Appendix D are used in the\ndesign process. For illustration, refer to the schematic critical depth chart and outlet\ncontrol nomograph shown in Figures 15 and 16, respectively.\na. Determine the tailwater depth above the outlet invert (TW) at the design flow rate.\nThis is obtained from backwater or normal depth calculations, or from field\nobservations.\n(1) If the Manning’s n value given in the outlet control nomograph is different than the\nManning’s n for the culvert, adjust the culvert length using the formula:\nThen, use L1rather than the actual culvert length when using the outlet control nomograph.\nAddress: Egypt: Villa 65, Mohamed Farid Axis, Hamd Sq., 5th Settlement, Cairo.\nUSA: 1856 Algonquin rd., Iowa City, IA 52245, Iowa State\nEmail: info@aiecons.com\nWebsite: www.aiecons.com\n- 41 -\nHydrological Study & Flood Protection Report\nElectrical Express Train-Blue Line\nSector ’C’ Part (1)\n(2) Using a straightedge, connect the culvert size (point 1) with the culvert length on\nthe appropriate scale (point 2).

If the outlet control headwater elevation exceeds the design headwater elevation, a\nnew culvert configuration must be selected, and the process repeated.

Under these conditions a\nminimum level of protection against erosion and abrasion should be provided. The\nobjective of providing the required protection and its quality is to resist the velocity of\nwater, with taking into consideration the natural conditions of the site. The proposed\nprotection structures can withstand the design storm, (design flows and resulting\nvelocities).\nGenerally, appropriate protection works will be provided in the entrance & exit of\nthe structures: Loose riprap will be used in the entrance & exit of each culvert.\nThe dimensions of the stones used in protection depends on the velocities at the\nentrance & exit of the culvert, Isbach equation will be used to calculate D50 for the\nstones as follow:\ng\nV\nD\nw\ns\nw\n2\n1\n2\n2\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n−\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nWhereas:\nD50: Avg.

The\nequation is expressed as follows:\nV = 1\nn R2/3S0.5\nWhere:\nV, is the mean velocity of flow, in m/s.\nn, is the Manning’s roughness coefficient for open channel flow, n should be\ntaken from appropriate tables, depending on channel types and materials, etc.\nR, is the hydraulic radius in m.\nS, is the slope of energy grade line, or channel bed slope, in m/m.\nAcceptable free board:\nThe minimum permissible vertical distance from the maximum water surface\ninside the channel to the upper level of the channel (min. Free board) is 25 cm, the\nbehavior of higher frequency discharges and the extent of their influence on both sides\nof the channel, as well as the effect of horizontal curves in the channel's path on the\ndepth of water would be studied.\nDesign speed for open channels:\nThe design velocities for the flow should be non-settling and non-scouring.\nMinimum velocities should be self-cleaning and prevent solids sedimentation in the\ndrainage, the maximum velocity shall be determined to reduce the negative effects of\nchannel erosion.\n• Min velocity in open channels is 0.75 m/s (self-cleaning velocity).\n• Max Velocity in the lined channels of the entire cross section is 4.5 m/s\nfor Grouted riprap & 6 m/s for lined concrete.\nAddress: Egypt: Villa 65, Mohamed Farid Axis, Hamd Sq., 5th Settlement, Cairo.\nUSA: 1856 Algonquin rd., Iowa City, IA 52245, Iowa State\nEmail: info@aiecons.com\nWebsite: www.aiecons.com\n- 46 -\nHydrological Study & Flood Protection Report\nElectrical Express Train-Blue Line\nSector ’C’ Part (1)\n5.4.3.1\nSide Ditch\nThe water is drained at cut sections by side ditches that convey the water drained\nfrom the embankment and cut slopes.

storms and their distribution and the areas affected by\nthese storms, and Surface runoff is the rate of movement or discharge of water\n(volume / time) in natural watercourses.\nFactors affecting runoff can be divided into rainfall-related factors such as rainfall\nintensity, duration of rainfall, return period of rainfall, distribution of rainfall over\nwatershed, and other factors associated with the watershed such as the area, the\nlength of the main stream, the slope of the main stream and the shape of the\nwatershed, as well as soil-related factors such as infiltration and land

Whenever water attacks the area under development, the flows\nmust be estimated accurately as possible and transported safely, so the design aims\nto provide drainage facilities that are capable of accommodation of the largest flood\ndischarges with the least maintenance over its lifetime.\nThe hydraulic design process consists of setting standards, developing, and\nevaluating alternatives, and selecting the alternative that meets the design standards.\n5.2 Returned Period\nIt is the frequency of storms within a specified period of time. The extent of the storm\nfrequency reflects the severity of the floods. The choice of the design period depends on the\nimportance and location of the proposed protection work.

It is recommended to use loose riprap protection\nwhen the flow velocity is less than 6.5 m/s and if the velocity exceeds 6.5\nm/s, an energy dissipater system should be used.\nAddress: Egypt: Villa 65, Mohamed Farid Axis, Hamd Sq., 5th Settlement, Cairo.\nUSA: 1856 Algonquin rd., Iowa City, IA 52245, Iowa State\nEmail: info@aiecons.com\nWebsite: www.aiecons.com\n- 29 -\nHydrological Study & Flood Protection Report\nElectrical Express Train-Blue Line\nSector ’C’ Part (2)\nGenerally, flow in culverts occurs under one of this two situations: inlet control\nculvert or outlet control culvert. For culverts designed according to the condition of\ninlet control, the characteristics of the culvert entrance will be such that losses\noccurred at entrance section are the dominant element in determining the height of\nthe water level of the culvert.\nIt is customary for the culvert to be designed under conditions of flows that\nare not fully submerged, meaning that the entrance surface of the culvert is above the\nwater level flowing through it wherever possible. Note that the maximum water level in\nthe upstream of the culvert before entering the drain facilities should not exceed 1.2 x\n(height of the culvert).\nThe general equations used while the design phase of culverts are as follows:\nFor box culverts:\nQ = n ∗1.5 ∗W ∗H1.5\nFor pipe culverts:\nQ = n ∗1.232 ∗D2.5\nWhereas:\nn: No. of Culvert openings.\nW: Box Culvert Width (m).\nH: Box Culvert Height (m).\nD: Pipe Culvert Diameter (m).\n(CulvertMaster) program will be used to determine the sizes of the proposed\nculverts, as well as to determine the level of water level at the entrance of the culvert\nand the exit velocity of water from it.\nBox Culverts are designed of reinforced concrete in streams and wadis where\nthe concrete allows the passage of maximum discharges while using an economical\nconcrete section. The multi-openings culverts are used in watersheds and waterways\nwhen needed instead of bridges, in the case of watersheds that are characterized by\nlong, mild & very wide longitudinal slopes, and the cross-section of the wadi is not well\nAddress: Egypt: Villa 65, Mohamed Farid Axis, Hamd Sq., 5th Settlement, Cairo.\nUSA: 1856 Algonquin rd., Iowa City, IA 52245, Iowa State\nEmail: info@aiecons.com\nWebsite: www.aiecons.com\n- 30 -\nHydrological Study & Flood Protection Report\nElectrical Express Train-Blue Line\nSector ’C’ Part (2)\ndefined. The multi-openings culverts are designed to accommodate the maximum\nflows that are likely to pass through.\nEntrance and exit structures are connected to the culvert in order to reduce the\nerosion of the embankment or the rail and slopes in the downstream, to prevent\nseepage, protection of embankments and structural fixation of the ends to improve the\nhydraulic properties of the culvert.\n5.4.1.1 • Types of Culverts Control.\nA general description of the characteristics of inlet and outlet control flow is given\nbelow. A culvert flowing in inlet control has shallow, high velocity flow categorized as\n\"supercritical.\" For supercritical flow, the control section is at the upstream end of the\nbarrel (the inlet). Conversely, a culvert flowing in outlet control will have relatively deep,\nlower velocity flow termed \"subcritical\" flow. For subcritical flow the control is at the\ndownstream end of the culvert (the outlet). The tail water depth is either critical depth\nat the culvert outlet or the downstream channel depth, whichever is higher.\na. Inlet Control\nFigure 12 depicts several different examples of inlet control flow. The type of flow\ndepends on the submergence of the inlet and outlet ends of the culvert. In all of these\nexamples, the control section is at the inlet end of the culvert. Depending on the\ntailwater, a hydraulic jump may occur downstream of the inlet.\nFigure 12-A depicts a condition where neither the inlet nor the outlet end of the\nculvert are submerged. The flow passes through critical depth just downstream of the\nculvert entrance and the flow in the barrel is supercritical. The barrel flows partly full\nover its length, and the flow approaches normal depth at the outlet end.\nFigure 12-B shows that submergence of the outlet end of the culvert does not\nassure outlet control. In this case, the flow just downstream of the inlet is supercritical\nand a hydraulic jump forms in the culvert barrel.\nFigure 12-C is a more typical design situation. The inlet end is submerged, and the\noutlet end flows freely. Again, the flow is supercritical and the barrel flows partly full\nover its length. Critical depth is located just downstream of the culvert entrance, and\nthe flow is approaching normal depth at the downstream end of the culvert.\nAddress: Egypt: Villa 65, Mohamed Farid Axis, Hamd Sq., 5th Settlement, Cairo.\nUSA: 1856 Algonquin rd., Iowa City, IA 52245, Iowa State\nEmail: info@aiecons.com\nWebsite: www.aiecons.com\n- 31 -\nHydrological Study & Flood Protection Report\nElectrical Express Train-Blue Line\nSector ’C’ Part (2)\nFigure 12-D is an unusual condition illustrating the fact that even submergence of\nboth the inlet and the outlet ends of the culvert does not assure full flow. In this case,\na hydraulic jump will form in the barrel. The median inlet provides ventilation of the\nculvert barrel. If the barrel were not ventilated, sub-atmospheric pressures could\ndevelop which might create an unstable condition during which the barrel would\nalternate between full flow and partly full flow.\nFigure 12 Types of inlet control\n• Factors Influencing Inlet Control\nSince the control is at the upstream end in inlet control, only the headwater and\nthe inlet configuration affect the culvert performance. The Head water depth is\nmeasured from the invert of the inlet control section to the surface of the upstream\npool. The inlet area is the cross-sectional area of the face of the culvert. Generally, the\ninlet face area is the same as the barrel area, but for tapered inlets the face area is\nenlarged, and the control section is at the throat. The inlet edge configuration\nAddress: Egypt: Villa 65, Mohamed Farid Axis, Hamd Sq., 5th Settlement, Cairo.\nUSA: 1856 Algonquin rd., Iowa City, IA 52245, Iowa State\nEmail: info@aiecons.com\nWebsite: www.aiecons.com\n- 32 -\nHydrological Study & Flood Protection Report\nElectrical Express Train-Blue Line\nSector ’C’ Part (2)\ndescribes the entrance type. Some typical inlet edge configurations are thin edge\nprojecting, mitered, square edges in a headwall, and beveled edge. The inlet shapes\nusually the same as the shape of the culvert barrel; however, it may be enlarged as in\nthe case of a tapered inlet. Typical shapes are rectangular, circular, and elliptical.\nWhenever the inlet face is a different size or shape than the culvert barrel, the\npossibility of an additional control section within the barrel exists.\nAn additional factor which influences inlet control performance is the barrel\nslope. The effect is small, however, and it can be ignored, or a small slope correction\nfactor can be inserted in the inlet control equations.\nThe inlet edge configuration is a major factor in inlet control performance, and\nit can be modified to improve performance.\n• Inlet Control Calculations\nThe inlet control calculations determine the headwater elevation required to\npass the design flow through the selected culvert configuration in inlet control. The\napproach velocity head may be included as part of the headwater, if desired.\nThe inlet control nomographs are used in the design process. For the following\ndiscussion, refer to the schematic inlet control nomograph shown in Figure 13.\na. Locate the selected culvert size (point 1) and flow rate (point 2) on the\nappropriate scales of the inlet control nomograph. (Note that for box culverts, the\nflow rate per foot of barrel width is used.)\nb. Using a straightedge, carefully extend a straight line from the culvert size (point\n1) through the flow rate (point 2) and mark a point on the first headwater/culvert\nheight (HW/D) scale (point 3). The first HW/D scale is also a turning line.\nc. If another HW/D scale is required, extend a horizontal line from the first HW/D\nscale (the turning line) to the desired scale and read the result.\nd. Multiply HW/D by the culvert height, D, to obtain the required headwater (HW)\nfrom the invert of the control section to the energy grade line. If the approach\nvelocity is neglected, HW equals the required headwater depth (HWi).

If the FALL is acceptable, proceed to\nstep f.\n(3) If the FALL is positive and greater than is judged to be acceptable, select\nanother culvert configuration and begin again at step a.\nf.

Outlet Control\nFigure 14 illustrates various outlet control flow conditions. In all cases, the\ncontrol section is at the outlet end of the culvert or further downstream.\nCondition 14-A represents the classic full flow condition, with both inlet and\noutlet submerged.\nThe barrel is in pressure flow throughout its length. This condition is often\nassumed in calculations, but seldom actually exists.\nCondition 14-B depicts the outlet submerged with the inlet unsubmerged. For\nthis case, the headwater is shallow so that the inlet crown is exposed as the flow\ncontracts into the culvert.\nCondition 14-C shows the entrance submerged to such a degree that the\nculvert flows full throughout its entire length while the exit is unsubmerged. This is a\nrare condition. It requires an extremely high headwater to maintain full barrel flow with\nno tailwater. The outlet velocities are usually high under this condition.\nCondition 14-D is more typical. The culvert entrance is submerged by the\nheadwater and the outlet end flows freely with a low tailwater. For this condition, the\nbarrel flows partly full over at least part of its length (subcritical flow) and the flow\npasses through critical depth just upstream of the outlet.\nCondition 14-E is also typical, with neither the inlet nor the outlet ends of the\nculvert submerged.\nThe barrel flows partly full over its entire length, and the flow profile is\nsubcritical.\nAddress: Egypt: Villa 65, Mohamed Farid Axis, Hamd Sq., 5th Settlement, Cairo.\nUSA: 1856 Algonquin rd., Iowa City, IA 52245, Iowa State\nEmail: info@aiecons.com\nWebsite: www.aiecons.com\n- 36 -\nHydrological Study & Flood Protection Report\nElectrical Express Train-Blue Line\nSector ’C’ Part (2)\nFigure 14 Types of Outlet Control\n• Factors Influencing Outlet Control.\nAll the factors influencing the performance of a culvert in inlet control also\ninfluence culverts in outlet control. In addition, the barrel characteristics (roughness,\narea, shape, length, and slope) and the tailwater elevation affect culvert performance\nin outlet control.\nThe barrel roughness is a function of the material used to fabricate the barrel.\nTypical materials include concrete and corrugated metal. The roughness is\nrepresented by a hydraulic resistance coefficient such as the Manning’s n value.\nAddress: Egypt: Villa 65, Mohamed Farid Axis, Hamd Sq., 5th Settlement, Cairo.\nUSA: 1856 Algonquin rd., Iowa City, IA 52245, Iowa State\nEmail: info@aiecons.com\nWebsite: www.aiecons.com\n- 37 -\nHydrological Study & Flood Protection Report\nElectrical Express Train-Blue Line\nSector ’C’ Part (2)\nThe barrel area and barrel shape are self-explanatory.\nThe barrel length is the total culvert length from the entrance to the exit of the\nculvert. Because the design height of the barrel and the slope influence the actual\nlength, an approximation of barrel length is usually necessary to begin the design\nprocess.\nThe barrel slope is the actual slope of the culvert barrel. The barrel slope is\noften the same as the natural stream slope. However, when the culvert inlet is raised\nor lowered, the barrel slope is different from the stream slope.\nThe tailwater elevation is based on the downstream water surface elevation.\nBackwater calculations from a downstream control, a normal depth approximation, or\nfield observations are used to define the tailwater elevation.\n• Outlet Control Calculations\nThe outlet control calculations result in the headwater elevation required to\nconvey the design discharge through the selected culvert in outlet control. The\napproach and downstream velocities may be included in the design process, if desired.\nThe critical depth charts and outlet control nomographs of Appendix D are used in the\ndesign process. For illustration, refer to the schematic critical depth chart and outlet\ncontrol nomograph shown in Figures 15 and 16, respectively.\na. Determine the tailwater depth above the outlet invert (TW) at the design flow rate.\nThis is obtained from backwater or normal depth calculations, or from field\nobservations.\n(1) If the Manning’s n value given in the outlet control nomograph is different than the\nManning’s n for the culvert, adjust the culvert length using the formula:\nThen, use L1rather than the actual culvert length when using the outlet control nomograph.\nAddress: Egypt: Villa 65, Mohamed Farid Axis, Hamd Sq., 5th Settlement, Cairo.\nUSA: 1856 Algonquin rd., Iowa City, IA 52245, Iowa State\nEmail: info@aiecons.com\nWebsite: www.aiecons.com\n- 38 -\nHydrological Study & Flood Protection Report\nElectrical Express Train-Blue Line\nSector ’C’ Part (2)\n(2) Using a straightedge, connect the culvert size (point 1) with the culvert length on\nthe appropriate scale (point 2). This defines a point on the turning line (point 3).\n(3) Again, using the straightedge, extend a line from the discharge (point 4) through\nthe point on\nthe turning line (point 3) to the Head Loss (H) scale.

If the outlet control headwater elevation exceeds the design headwater elevation, a\nnew culvert configuration must be selected, and the process repeated.

Under these conditions a\nminimum level of protection against erosion and abrasion should be provided. The\nobjective of providing the required protection and its quality is to resist the velocity of\nwater, with taking into consideration the natural conditions of the site. The proposed\nprotection structures can withstand the design storm, (design flows and resulting\nvelocities).\nGenerally, appropriate protection works will be provided in the entrance & exit of\nthe structures: Loose riprap will be used in the entrance & exit of each culvert.\nThe dimensions of the stones used in protection depends on the velocities at the\nentrance & exit of the culvert, Isbach equation will be used to calculate D50 for the\nstones as follow:\ng\nV\nD\nw\ns\nw\n2\n1\n2\n2\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n−\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nWhereas:\nD50: Avg.

      "FINAL DESIGN OF DRAINAGE SYSTEM REPORT": "Client\n5\n1\n6\nThe general grading plan and layout of the hill are presented in Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4\nillustrate the hill cross-sectional view (B-B).\nFigure 2: Grading layout of CICPA Hill\n7\nFigure 3: General Grading Plan of CICPA Hill\nFigure 4: Cross-Sectional View (Section B-B)\nAs per requirements in project specifications [1][2] for the development of the CICPA hill, the\npresence of high-fine-content material in shallow layers, which exhibit low permeability/\nconductivity properties might delay water drainage or trap water from different  sources, i.e.\nprecipitation, irrigation, hydraulic fill, …etc. Therefore, the application of many drainage systems\nsuch as drainage layer, vertical drains or a combination of both, was evaluated considering the\n8\nactual thickness of drainage layer and the actual depth of vertical drains. Based on the prior study\nof the drainage systems, it was determined that a drainage system is required to drain hill's water.\nFollowing a thorough design study, the vertical drains system where we have recommended.\n1.2\nObjective of This Document\nThe objective of this report is to present the following:\n* Description of CICPA Hill 3-D numerical model.\n▪\nApplication results of the 3-D simulation of the drainage system (vertical drains).\n▪\nAssessment results of the effectiveness of the drainage system (vertical drains) in draining\nhill's water.\n▪\nThe design drawings of the drainage system (vertical drains).\n▪\nThe quantity of material that is used in constructing the drainage system (vertical drains).\nFinally, the conclusion of the model results and recommendations for the drainage system have\nbeen presented, indicating that the expected drainage time for the seepage water inside the hill to\nreach +5.00 m NADD is within 6 months, as requested.\n9\n2\n10\nTable 1: Native Ground Subsurface layers\nLayer No.\nLayer Description\nHydraulic conductivity (m/d)\n1\nHill\n0.33\n2\nSilty Sand\n9.50\n3\nSilty Clay\n0.08\n4\nMudstone\n8.64E-06\n5\nGypsum\n8.64E-06\nTable 1 was derived from the geotechnical report provided by NMDC and the raw data provided by\nADEC. This table reflects the hydraulic properties used in the model, with the majority of the\navailable raw data falling within the Silty Sand layer (more than 80% of the data). Figure 6 shows\nthat the median hydraulic conductivity value of the native soil has been chosen to be 9.50 m/d (the\nmost critical layers for drainage).Therefore, the analysis of stratigraphy and parameters of hydraulic\nconductivity shall be explained in the following sections.\nFigure 6: Raw data analysis for the Silty Sand Layer\nFor the Hill conductivity, a multi criteria evaluation has been conducted to choose the optimum and\nmost effective value.\nThis criterion is based on the worst case scenario that the Hill is divided into 5 platforms, and the\nmaterial does not conform to the best soil mixture, therefore, as illustrated in Table 2, different\nmixture of soils has been chosen, then taken the first quartile as highlighted.\n11\nTable 2: Hill Material Statistics\nPlatform No. Percentage of\nSoil Hyd.\nConductivity\n(k= 1E-5 m/s)\nPercentage of\nSoil Hyd.\nConductivity\n(k= 1E-6 m/s)\nResulted soil\nmixture Hyd.\nConductivity\n(m/s)\nStatistics\n1\n80\n20\n2.80E-06\nFirst quartile (m/s)\n3.82E-06\n2\n64\n42\n4.84E-06\nMedian (m/s)\n6.40E-06\n3\n40\n60\n6.40E-06\nThird quartile (m/s) 7.75E-06\n4\n30\n70\n7.30E-06\n5\n20\n80\n8.20E-06\n2.1\nPost-improvement Conditions of Native Ground and Hill\nThe lateral extent of ground improvement (GI) requirements for the hills in order to meet the\nground improvement criteria for global stability, bearing capacity, settlement, and liquefaction is\npresented in Figure 7. The treatment area is divided into two zones (Zone 1 and Zone 2), where the\nintermediate boundary is defined at +10.0m NADD hill contour grading.\nFigure 7: Typical Detail of Vertical and Lateral Extent of Ground Improvement for the Hill and Native\nGround\n12\n2.2\nSubsurface Soil Characterization\nA thorough analysis of all drilled boreholes and CPT raw data across the project site was conducted\nto gain a comprehensive understanding of the subsurface soil conditions by interpolate and\nextrapolate all available data by natural neighbour method inside project boundary Figure 5. This\ndetailed analysis resulted in the development of the cross-section presented in Figure 8. As shown\nin the cross-sections Figure 9 and horizontal sections for native soil at different levels in [Appendix\nB], the site primarily consists of three different main soil layers extending across most of the area\nwith varying depths as follows:\nSilty Sand: This surface layer, occasionally containing gravel in some locations, was encountered in\nall boreholes. Based on the analyzed data, the estimated hydraulic conductivity of the silty sand\nlayer is 1.10 E-4 m/s (Figure 6).\nSilty Clay: Underlying the silty sand layer in huge area across the entire site, a relatively\nimpermeable silty clay layer was encountered. The coefficient of permeability values provided in\nthe soil test results were analyzed to determine an estimated hydraulic conductivity of 9.26 × 10^-\n7 m/s for the silty clay layer (based on the geotechnical report).\nSilty Sand: Located beneath the Silty clay layer, silty sand deposits were observed at varying depths\nacross the site in specific boreholes.

The derivation of the\ngeneralized governing equation of groundwater flow in saturated media has been described in\nmany references including those by Bear (1978), Anderson and Woessner (1992), Kresic (1997), and\nSchwartz and Zhang (2003). The partial differential equation can be written as:\nWhere\nKxx, Kyy, and Kzz equal horizontal hydraulic conductivity along the x, y, and z axes [LT –1];\nh equals the potentiometric head [L];\nW equals sources or sinks of water (volumetric rate per unit volume)\n21\n5.1.2.1\nBoundary Conditions\nType 1. Specified head boundary (Dirichlet condition) in which the hydraulic head or potentiometric\nlevel is specified. When the hydraulic head is a constant value, such as a boundary representing sea\nlevel, this boundary is also referred to as a constant-head boundary condition.\nType 2. Specified flow boundary (Neumann condition) in which the gradient of the head (or flux)\nacross a boundary is given. When the flux is specified as zero, this represents a no-flow boundary\ncondition.\nType 3. Head-dependent flow boundary (Cauchy or mixed boundary) in which the flux over a\nboundary is calculated given a head value at the boundary. This boundary condition type is also\nknown as a generalized-head boundary in model applications.\n5.1.2.2\nInitial Conditions\nUnder steady-state conditions (the right-hand side of Equation 1.1 is zero), initial conditions do not\nneed to be specified. For transient or unsteady-state conditions, initial conditions supply the\nhydraulic head or potentiometric level everywhere within the domain of interest at some initial\ntime such as steady-state (e.g., time = 0).\nThe system represented by Equation 1.1 and the respective boundary conditions can be solved\nusing analytical and numerical methods. Analytical solutions are only available for simple systems,\nwhile complex systems require numerical methods (e.g., finite-difference or finite-element\nmethods). The numerical code used in this study (e.g., MODFLOW-NWT) is one of the solvers\navailable in MODFLOW-NWT. The NWT package is only used with the UPW Package. Using the NWT\nsolver requires twice the memory of other MODFLOW solvers because using the Newton method\nresults in an asymmetric matrix.   MODFLOW-NWT includes two previously developed asymmetric\nmatrix-solver options. The matrix-solver options include a generalized-minimum-residual (GMRES)\nSolver and an orthomin / stabilized conjugate-gradient (CGSTAB) Solver. Details of the solution\n22\nother MODFLOW solvers because using the Newton method results in an asymmetric matrix.\nBecause of the asymmetric matrix a different matrix solver must be used. The NWT package\nprovides an option to use one of two matrix solvers: a generalized-minimum-residual (GMRES)\nsolver and an Orthomin/stabilized conjugate-gradient solver called χMD (chi-MD).\nNumerical models are capable of solving the more complex equations that describe groundwater\nflow and solute transport. These equations generally describe multi-dimensional groundwater flow,\nsolute transport, and chemical reactions, although there are one-dimensional numerical models.\nNumerical models use approximations (e.g. finite differences, or finite elements) to solve the\ndifferential equations describing groundwater flow or solute transport. The approximations require\nthat the model domain and time be discretized. In this discretization process, the model domain is\nrepresented by a network of grid cells or elements, and the duration of the simulation is\nrepresented by a series of time steps.\nThe accuracy of numerical models depends upon the accuracy of the model input data, the size of\nthe space and time discretization (the greater the size of the discretization steps, the greater the\npossible error), and the numerical method used to solve the model equations.\nNumerical models may be used to:\n▪\nSimulate very simple one- or two-dimensional flow and transport conditions, which may just\nas easily be simulated using an analytical model,\n▪\nModel more complex two- or three-dimensional groundwater flow and solute-transport\nproblems,\n▪\nSimulate steady-state or transient groundwater flow or solute transport,\n▪\nAssess regional- or local-scale flow or transport,\n▪\nEstimate fluxes at simple or complex hydrogeologic boundaries.\nThe objective of constructing a numerical groundwater flow model of the CICPA Hill groundwater\nbasin was to gain a better understanding of the aquifer lithology and evaluate the infiltration time\nfor the hill's water with a drainage system alternative.\nThe numerical model used for this study is the USGS modular three-dimensional finite-difference\ngroundwater flow model (MODFLOW) (McDonald and Harbaugh, 1988). Groundwater levels were\ncalculated at discrete points by solving simultaneous equations that approximate the partial\ndifferential equation for groundwater flow. The discrete points are the result of the discretization\nof the model area into a series of layered square model cells with the points (or nodes) located at\nthe center of the model cells.\n23\n6\n24\nAccordingly, the model domain is discretized into a grid that consists of a finite difference mesh of\neight layers to represent the aquifer system. The total number of rows and columns of the model\ngrid are 260 and 323 respectively, number of active cells are 292224, and number of inactive cells\nare 379616 cells as shown in  Figure 16. The model grid consists of regular cell sizes.\nFigure 15: Model domain and discretization.\nFigure 16: 3D active grid numerical model.\n25\nIn order to reduce the numerical simulation time, the outer inactive cells of the domain are\nexcluded from the model. Figure 16 shows the active model domain by GMS software.\n6.2.2 Initial Conditions\nThe initial boundary condition is given to all the model domain as the water level at any point within\nthe hill equals to its corresponding elevation (Fully Saturated Hill).\n6.2.3 Boundary Conditions\nThe boundaries for the model domain are selected as follows:\n▪\nFor the Hill: The Second type boundary (Recharge boundary) is assigned to allow water to\nflow through the Hill Surface.\n▪\nFor the Native Soil: Constant head boundary that equals zero is assigned at the Sea Water\nLevel around the whole base of the model and inside the aquifer system.\n▪\nVertical drains have been assigned as drains as per drawings.\nBoundary conditions are assigned for all simulations as follows:\nSteady state:\nThe First type boundary (Constant head boundary) is assigned at the Sea Water Level around the\nwhole base of the model and inside the aquifer system, in addition to, the Second type boundary\n(Recharge boundary) is assigned to allow water to flow through the Hill Surface.\nTransient state:\nThe initial condition is taken as the results of the steady state conditions, with the same boundary\nconditions.\n26\nFigure 17: Model Domain and Boundary Conditions\nFigure 18: 3D Model Domain and Boundary Conditions\n27\n6.2.4 Model Topography\nThe topography of the Hill has been imported via the 3D surface provided by the Client, Figure 3.\nThe maximum ground elevation in the domain reaches 55 m at the top of the Hill. The differences\nin the surface elevation control the flow direction of the surface water as well as the groundwater\nwithin the aquifer system.\n6.2.5 Recharge Conditions\nBased on the rainfall data explained in Section 3.2, and expected leakage from future wet utilities,\nthe recharge value has been considered to take into account the recent high rainfall rate that\nhappened in the early months of 2024, with a factor of 15%, 0.02 m/day.

The vertical drains are to be implemented from\ncrushed stone as a rapid draining material with a high hydraulic conductivity (i.e. 300 to 1000\nm/day) to facilitate and improve the soil drainage properties of the hill body in order to drain the\nhill's water into the sea in the appropriate time. The vertical drains penetrate the native soil with a\nminimum depth of 2.0 m in the sand layer.\nA 3-d numerical model was developed to simulate the drainage system under the hydrologic\nconditions of a design storm of 0.02 m/day (the highest rainfall event occur in 2024). The simulation\nresults showed propagation of the water levels within the hill's body until reaching +5.00 m NADD\nwithin 6 months as requested.\nThe simulation results showed the water levels at the different time steps till reaching the total\ndrainage time of 6 months.\nWe recommend that the Contractor to consider precautions against erosion by the rainfall water\nrunning on the side slopes

      "INTRODUCTION": "1.1\nGeneral\nModon Properties (Employer) is developing Al Hudayriyat Island into a mix of residential, leisure\nand commercial land use including villas, townhouses and other leisure and entertainment facilities.\nEastern Hudayriyat Island is currently being considered, Figure 1, for further expansion. A series of\nreclamation works are reclaimed CICPA Hill.\nFigure 1: Proposed Hudayriyat Island Masterplan (Including the Hudayriyat East Development)\nThe footprint area of the CICPA Hill is in the order of 2,00,000 m2. Part of the Hill is expected to be\nresting on a reclaimed Island. The tentative height of the Hill is up to +55m NADD, while the existing\nground level is at an approximate level of +2m NADD. The Hill's steep sides are provided with\nbenches (or terraces) at approximately 10 m height intervals. The width of each terrace varies\nbetween 70m to 100m. These terraces provide a stable base for the construction of houses and\ninfrastructure.",
      "GEOTECHNICAL CONDITIONS": "Table 1 shows the soil hydraulic parameters based on a review and interpretation of existing\ngeotechnical information as well as borehole data. From the 25 boreholes drilled at the location,\nFigure 5, the groundwater was encountered between 1.50 m to 2.75 m below the existing ground,\ni.e. the groundwater level was between -0.68 m NADD to +0.91 m NADD. The ground water level\nconsidered for geotechnical design is at +0.5 m NADD, which also corresponds to the water\nbetween MHHW and MLHW level.\nFigure 5: Executive Boreholes location and CPT data analysis in the project boundary.",
      "HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS": "3.1\nGroundwater Conditions\nBased on the review and interpretation of available soil information, the groundwater was\nencountered between 1.5 m and 2.75 m below the existing ground surface in various boreholes,\ntranslating to a groundwater level ranging from -0.68 m NADD to +0.91 m NADD. For geotechnical\ndesign purposes, a groundwater level of +0.5 m NADD is considered, which also corresponds to the\nwater level between the Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) and Mean Lower Low Water (MLHW)\nlevels.\n3.2\nRainfall Analysis\nThe initial water head resulting from the hydraulic fill equals the total height of the hill, although\nthe water head measurements of the existing hills (east and west hills) indicated that this\nassumption is conservative. The available measurements from the east and west hills indicated that\nthe initial water head after completion of the hills' construction was about +35.0 m NADD, whereas\nthe top levels were about +45 and +55 m NADD in the east and west hills, respectively. The relatively\nlow initial water head was attributed to the drainage rate during construction and ground\nimprovement. Applying a heavy rainfall event to all the simulated scenarios will not change the\nresults concerning the drainage performance since the CICPA hill was assumed to be in a fully\nsaturated condition. The effects of different water sources, such as precipitation and irrigation, and\nthe associated mitigation measures, have been added to the recharge that acts on the Hill.\nBased on the Volume I- Design Manual of Storm water & Subsoil Drainage Systems 2022, the Arab\nUnited Emirates is divided into two zones. The first zone (Zone A) is devoted to Al Ain region while\nthe second zone (Zone B) is devoted to the remaining part of the country, as shown in Figure 10.\nFigure 10:  Hydrological Zones of UAE.",
      "DRAINAGE SYSTEM": "The drainage system includes vertical drains consisting of crushed stone columns enveloped with\nnon-woven geotextile filter fabric to facilitate and improve the soil properties of the hill material\nand to drain water from the entire hill body to the sea. Figure 12 illustrates the cross section A-A\npassing by some of the vertical drains.\nThe efficiency and distribution of the vertical drains have been evaluated in the concept design\nstage and it was found the 368 drains with depths ranging from 15 m to 20 m are adequate to\nachieve the drainage of the hill within the appropriate time, referring to Appendix A.  These columns\nhave been chosen with a specific criterion (location and depth) to drain the water from the hill to\nthe native soil inside the highest available permeable layer as shown in Figure 13.\nFigure 12: Drainage system (Vertical drains) along cross section A-A.",

      "Introduction": "The simulation team of AIECON constructed and developed the simulation model of the hill and its\nbasement native and improved layers considering the available data of the hill geometry as well as\nthe hydraulic properties of the different layers. The following sections present the modelling steps\nand results.\n5.1.1 Groundwater Modelling\nIn general, models are conceptual descriptions or approximations that describe physical systems\nusing mathematical equations; they are not exact descriptions of physical systems or processes.\nThe applicability, or usefulness, of a model depends on how closely the mathematical equations\napproximate the physical system being modelled. To evaluate a model's applicability or usefulness,\na thorough understanding of the physical system and the assumptions embedded in the derivation\nof the mathematical equations will produce better predictions.\nGroundwater models describe groundwater flow and fate-and-transport processes using\nmathematical equations that are based on certain simplifying assumptions. These assumptions\ntypically involve the direction of flow, the geometry of the aquifer, the heterogeneity or anisotropy\nof sediments or bedrock comprising the aquifer, the contaminant transport mechanisms, and\nchemical reactions. Because of the simplifying assumptions embedded in the mathematical\nequations and the many uncertainties in the values of data required by the model, a model provides\npredictions as an approximation and not an exact duplication of field conditions.\nGroundwater-flow models are used to calculate the rate and direction of movement of\ngroundwater through aquifers and confining units in the subsurface, and the exchange of\ngroundwater between aquifers and sources and sinks, where groundwater is added or removed\nfrom the aquifer. These calculations are referred to as “simulations.” The simulation of\ngroundwater flow depends upon a thorough understanding of the hydrogeologic characteristics of\nthe facility and the surrounding area.\nA groundwater-flow model simulates the following processes:\n▪\nMovement of groundwater through aquifers and confining layers,\n▪\nAddition of groundwater by sources such as precipitation, leakage from surface water\nbodies, injection wells, infiltration galleries, etc.,\n▪\nRemoval of groundwater by sinks such as pumping wells, drains, surface water bodies,\ninterceptor trenches, etc., or\n▪\nThe change in hydraulic head and hydraulic gradients as a result of the addition or removal\nof groundwater by sources and sinks.",
