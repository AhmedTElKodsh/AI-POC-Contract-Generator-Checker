# Integration Guides for Advanced AI Techniques Domain Expansion

## RLHF Integration Guide
1. Collect human feedback on negotiation outcomes from past contracts.
2. Train a reward model using libraries like TRL.
3. Fine-tune the language model with PPO for contract negotiation scenarios.
4. Integrate into the contract writing pipeline to suggest fair terms.
5. Ensure compliance with legal standards and AI ethics.

## GANs Integration Guide
1. Gather real project data samples (anonymized).
2. Implement GAN using TensorFlow or PyTorch to generate synthetic data.
3. Validate synthetic data for realism and diversity.
4. Use synthetic data to augment training datasets for AI models in civil engineering.
5. Integrate into data pipelines for better model generalization.

## Multimodal Models Integration Guide
1. Preprocess scanned documents to extract text and images.
2. Use CLIP or similar models to understand document content.
3. Train on multimodal datasets including scanned proposals.
4. Integrate into document processing workflow for better extraction and analysis.
5. Combine with RAG systems for querying multimodal content.
