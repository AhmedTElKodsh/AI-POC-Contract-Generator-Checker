- **Status File:** `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/bmm-workflow-status.yaml`

## 🚀 How to Use BMAD-METHOD

### Option 1: Check Workflow Status (Recommended First Step)

Simply type in your chat:

```
*workflow-status
```

This will show you:

- Current project status
- Next recommended workflow
- Available options

### Option 2: Document Your Existing Codebase

Since this is an existing project, start by documenting it:

```
*document-project
```

This workflow will:

- Analyze your codebase structure
- Document architecture patterns
- Create reference documentation for AI agents
- Identify key components and dependencies

### Option 3: Quick Development

For quick feature development without full planning:

```
*quick-dev
```

Use this when you want to:

- Add a small feature
- Fix a bug
- Make quick changes

### Option 4: Full Planning for New Features

For major features, follow the structured approach:

1. **Create a PRD** (Product Requirements Document)

   ```
   *create-prd
   ```

2. **Design Architecture**

   ```
   *create-architecture
   ```

3. **Create Stories**

   ```
   *create-epics-and-stories
   ```

4. **Develop**
   ```
   *dev-story
   ```

## 📚 Key Workflows for Your AI Contract Generator

- `*sprint-planning` - Plan sprints
- `*retrospective` - Review completed work

## 💡 Recommended Workflow for Your Project

Based on your AI Contract Generator project, here's a suggested path:

### Phase 1: Document Current State

1. Run `*document-project` to analyze your existing codebase
2. Run `*generate-project-context` to create AI agent context

### Phase 2: Plan Architecture Documentation

3. Run `*create-architecture` to document:
   - RAG architecture
   - NLP pipeline (Arabic/English)
   - Vector database (Qdrant)
   - Document ingestion flow
   - Generation pipeline

### Phase 3: Plan Enhancements

4. Run `*create-prd` for new features like:
   - Enhanced Arabic NLP
   - Improved cost estimation
   - New proposal templates
   - API endpoints

### Phase 4: Implement & Test

5. Run `*create-epics-and-stories` to break down work
6. Run `*testarch-framework` to set up testing
7. Run `*dev-story` to implement features

## 🤖 Available Agents

You can load different specialized agents for different tasks:

- **PM** - Product Manager (for PRDs)
- **Architect** - Solution Architect (for architecture)
- **Dev** - Developer (for implementation)
- **TEA** - Test Engineer Architect (for testing)
- **Quick Flow Solo Dev** - Fast solo development
- **Tech Writer** - Documentation

To use an agent, load it in your IDE/chat interface.

## 📖 Example: Document Your Project

Let's start by documenting your existing codebase. Here's what to do:

1. **Type this command:**

   ```
   *document-project
   ```

2. **The workflow will:**

   - Scan your `src/` directory
   - Analyze your models, NLP, RAG, and API modules
   - Document the architecture
   - Create comprehensive reference docs

3. **Output will be saved to:**
   - `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/project-documentation.md`
