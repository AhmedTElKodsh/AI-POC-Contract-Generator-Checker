        r'Eurocode\s*[0-9]',
        r'BS\s*EN\s*199[0-9]'
    ]
    detected_codes = []
    for pattern in eurocode_patterns:
        matches = re.findall(pattern, contract_text, re.IGNORECASE)
        detected_codes.extend(matches)

    compliance_issues = []

    # Check partial safety factors
    if 'partial_factor' not in contract_text.lower():
