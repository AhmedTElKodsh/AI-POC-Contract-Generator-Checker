# Completion Report: Advanced AI Techniques Domain Expansion

## Overview
Successfully executed research stories for RLHF in contract negotiation, GANs for synthetic project data, and multimodal models for scanned docs. Followed the workflow: defined stories, implemented deliverables, validated, and integrated into the knowledge base.

## Stories Defined
- **Story 1: RLHF for Contract Negotiation**
  - Objective: Enhance AI-driven contract negotiation with RLHF for fairness and compliance.
  - Deliverables: Glossary, references, API docs, integration guide.

- **Story 2: GANs for Synthetic Project Data**
  - Objective: Generate synthetic data for AI training in civil engineering.
  - Deliverables: Glossary, references, API docs, integration guide.

- **Story 3: Multimodal Models for Scanned Docs**
  - Objective: Process scanned documents using multimodal AI.
  - Deliverables: Glossary, references, API docs, integration guide.

## Deliverables Implemented
- **Glossaries**: Compiled in `advanced_ai_glossaries.md` with key terms for each technique.
- **Technical References**: Listed in `advanced_ai_references.md` with papers and articles.
- **API Documentation**: Provided in `advanced_ai_api_docs.md` with relevant libraries and APIs.
- **Integration Guides**: Outlined in `advanced_ai_integration_guides.md` with step-by-step instructions.

## Validation
- JSON knowledge base validated for syntax correctness.
- Content reviewed for relevance and accuracy.

## Integration
- Added "advanced_ai_techniques" domain to `knowledge_base.json` with all sections: glossary, technical_references, api_docs, integration_guides.

## Completion Status
All tasks completed successfully. Knowledge base expanded with advanced AI techniques for improved AI-POC-Contract-Generator-Checker functionality.
