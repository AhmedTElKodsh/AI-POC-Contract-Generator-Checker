# Glossaries for Advanced AI Techniques Domain Expansion

## RLHF Glossary
- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**: A technique to align AI models with human preferences using reinforcement learning and human feedback.
- **Reward Model**: A model trained to predict human preferences from feedback data.
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: An algorithm used in RLHF to fine-tune the policy based on reward signals.
- **Human Feedback**: Annotations or rankings provided by humans to guide model training.
- **Language Models**: AI models that generate or understand human language.
